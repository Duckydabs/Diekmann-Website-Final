        </div>
        <h3>My name is Matthew Diekmann and I am currently a junior enrolled in the computer science program at SICTC. I have learned a lot about myself and my future career by taking this class.</h3>
        <h3>I came to SICTC with the intention of enjoying coding and continuing my career in the field, however after having taken a year, I have decided that coding is not for me.</h3>
        <h3>With this new knowledge, I have thought about my future career more than ever before. Ultimately, I have decided that I want to make money right from my computer and travel the world. I will not be continuing education into college but rather get straight to work.</h3>
        <h3>I am very grateful for the opportunities that I have had into my education as I would not be the man I am today without them. Though difficult, my path will be rewarding and I will do what is required to succeed.</h3>
